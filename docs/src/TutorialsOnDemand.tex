  \frametitle{Tutorials on demand}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item I accept requests for doing tutorials on demand, outside of regular RCC Workshops schedule
    \item The tutorials can also be integrated into regular courses. For example, last year I did 
      \begin{itemize}
      \item ``Distributed MPI Programming in Python'' as part of the ``Computational Astrophysics'' course for graduate students
      \item ``Deep Learning with Keras'' as part of the ``Computational Physics'' course for undergraduate students
      \end{itemize}
    \item Currently the following tutorials are available at any time:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Distributed MPI programming in C/C++/Python
        \item Introduction to Linux and RCC
        \item Introduction to Python
        \item Introduction to Hadoop
        \item Deep Learning with Keras and TensorFlow
        \item Deep Learning with Theano
        \item Singularity Container
        \item Introduction to Spark
      \end{itemize}
    \item More are coming soon...
  \end{itemize}
